# Bayko & Brown: CloudToon Studio

(AKA: Agent-Powered Cartoon Generation Pipeline)

## üîπ Overview

**Bayko & Brown** is a secure, cloud-native pipeline that transforms user prompts into fully generated comic strips using GenAI agents in isolated VPCs.

The system demonstrates advanced AWS networking principles including VPC design, cross-VPC communication via S3, subnet isolation, secure firewalls, and event-driven workflows.

---

## üí° Use Case

A user enters a storytelling prompt via a secure WebUI (like Andrew's Smart TV).  
The system responds with:

- Stylized dialogue
- Rendered comic panels
- Optional voiceover narration

Behind the scenes, two agents ‚Äî Bayko and Brown ‚Äî process and generate the comic collaboratively while remaining isolated via network boundaries.

## üìö Architecture Diagrams

This project includes a full suite of system diagrams in [architecture.md](./architecture.md), covering:

- üß† System Architecture Overview
- üîÅ Agent Processing Flow
- üîÄ MCP Subsystem Orchestration
- üì¶ Output Artifact Structure
- üîê Network Security & Isolation

Each diagram is rendered using Mermaid and maps directly to the actual infrastructure and agent logic used in the pipeline.

## üë• Agent Roles

Detailed breakdown of each GenAI agent is available in [agents.md](./agents.md):

- ü§ñ **Agent Brown**: Input validator, style tagger, and storyboard author
- üß† **Agent Bayko**: MCP-driven backend agent for image, audio, and video generation

Covers toolchain decisions, moderation logic, and agent boundaries.

---

## üé¨ Pipeline Steps

1. **User enters prompt via WebUI (external interface)**

   - Frontend interface (Smart TV style)
   - Sends the prompt to Agent Brown via API Gateway or ALB (VPC-Brown)

2. **Agent Brown processes the prompt**

   - Sanitizes, styles, and tags the request
   - Creates `storyboard.json` with layout, dialogue, UUID, metadata
   - Writes it to S3 ‚Äúwindow‚Äù bucket (shared resource)

3. **S3 triggers Agent Bayko (VPC-Bayko)**

   - Via S3 event or EventBridge
   - Bayko receives `storyboard.json` and begins generation

4. **Agent Bayko uses MCP internally**

   - **MCP is a protocol inside Bayko**, not an external router
   - Bayko uses it to:
     - Choose between SDXL or other tools
     - Decide if TTS is needed
     - Assemble toolchain for current task
     - Optionally spawn subagents or use modal tools
   - All decisions are logged or passed through a planner module

5. **Bayko generates the full comic output**

   - Generates dialogue (if needed), renders frames
   - Adds narration/subtitles if requested
   - Outputs media as `.mp4`, `.zip`, or image bundle

6. **Bayko writes to Output S3 ("Jellyfin Server")**

   - Stored under `output/{UUID}/final.mp4`
   - Contains images, audio, captions, metadata, logs

7. **Agent Brown detects output and responds to WebUI**
   - Delivers signed URL (CloudFront or pre-signed S3)
   - Optionally logs session metadata

## üîê Security Philosophy

This system mimics secure enterprise infrastructure:

- No direct A2A traffic
- All agent interaction flows through monitored ‚Äúwindows‚Äù (S3)
- Layer 4 firewalls prevent direct ingress to Bayko ‚Äî access only via triggers
- Optional NAT Gateway + VPC peering simulate advanced network boundaries
- Lambdas serve as trusted relays only ‚Äî no wide-open ingress
