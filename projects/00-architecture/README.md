# Bayko & Brown: Multi-Agent Orchestration System

_Secure agent isolation and event-driven coordination for AI workflows._

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **multi-agent orchestration system** with two isolated agents operating across separate VPCs, coordinated through S3 and event-driven triggers.

The architecture focuses on **secure networking, agent isolation, and event-driven coordination** — core patterns for distributed AI systems.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**Core Components:**

- **Agent Brown (Public VPC)**: Input validation, request processing, task routing
- **Agent Bayko (Private VPC)**: Backend processing, tool orchestration, output assembly
- **S3 Communication Bridge**: Secure cross-VPC agent coordination
- **EventBridge Triggers**: Event-driven workflow orchestration
- **CloudFront CDN**: Secure, scalable output delivery

**Security Model:**

- Layer 4 firewall isolation between agents
- IAM roles with least-privilege access
- No direct agent-to-agent communication
- VPC-level network segmentation

---

## 🔀 MCP (Model Context Protocol) System

Bayko's internal orchestration engine provides:

- **Dynamic Tool Selection**: Context-aware routing between processing services
- **State Management**: Task queuing, dependency tracking, resource pooling
- **Failure Handling**: Retry logic, graceful degradation, error recovery
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tool usage metrics, latency tracking, quality validation
