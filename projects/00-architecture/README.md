# Bayko & Brown: Multi-Agent Orchestration System

_Production-grade AI agents that can't talk to each other (by design)._

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Ever wondered how enterprise AI systems handle security? This project demonstrates **zero-trust multi-agent architecture** where AI agents are completely isolated but still coordinate seamlessly through AWS infrastructure.

**Perfect for:**

- 🏢 Enterprise environments requiring agent isolation
- 🔒 Compliance-heavy industries (finance, healthcare, government)
- 🎓 Learning advanced AWS networking patterns
- 🛡️ Understanding zero-trust AI architecture

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project showcases a **multi-agent orchestration system** featuring two isolated agents operating in separate VPCs, coordinated via S3 and EventBridge. The system enforces **zero direct communication**, relying on **event-driven task execution** and strict IAM boundaries.

**Key Architecture Principles:**

- 🚫 **Zero Direct Communication**: Agents never talk directly
- 🔐 **VPC-Level Isolation**: Complete network separation
- 📦 **S3 as Message Bus**: Secure, auditable data handoff
- ⚡ **Event-Driven**: EventBridge orchestrates everything
- 🛡️ **IAM Boundaries**: Least-privilege security model

**Tech Stack:** AWS VPC, Lambda, ECS, S3, EventBridge, CloudFront

## 🏗️ How It Works

![Agent Flow](assets/aws_diagrams/png/06_agent_flow.drawio.png)

**The Flow:**

1. **User** submits request → **Agent Brown** (public VPC)
2. **Brown** validates input → writes to **S3**
3. **S3** triggers **EventBridge** → wakes up **Agent Bayko** (private VPC)
4. **Bayko** processes task → writes output to **S3**
5. **CloudFront** delivers results → **User**

**The Magic:** Agents never communicate directly, yet the system works seamlessly.

## 🧱 Core Components

- **Agent Brown (Public VPC)**: Input validation, metadata tagging, request submission
- **Agent Bayko (Private VPC)**: Tool orchestration, quality validation, output generation
- **S3 Communication Bridge**: Cross-VPC task handoff with signed payloads
- **EventBridge**: Triggers Bayko based on S3 activity
- **CloudFront (Optional)**: Output distribution with signed URLs

---

## 🔐 Security Model

- No agent-to-agent communication
- S3 used as an air-gapped transport mechanism
- EventBridge isolates execution control
- IAM separation and scoped permissions per role
- VPC-level firewall isolation (Layer 4)

## 🧰 Internal Routing System (Bayko)

Bayko uses a task router to:

- Select tools based on processing profile
- Handle failure fallbacks
- Track quality metrics and generate structured outputs
