# üìà Performance Considerations & Traffic Expectations

This document outlines **expected behavior** of the Bayko & Brown architecture based on its design. These projections are not derived from real deployments, but instead rely on:

- Official AWS documentation
- Public benchmarks from service documentation or re\:Invent talks
- Known latency ranges from infrastructure blogs and architectural guidance

The goal is to identify potential bottlenecks, plan around realistic SLAs, and document performance-aware tradeoffs.

## 1. Request Flow Expectations

### End-to-End Path

> User ‚Üí ALB ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Agent Brown ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí EventBridge ‚Üí Agent Bayko ‚Üí Output S3 ‚Üí CloudFront

### Anticipated Characteristics

- **Agent Brown** (Lambda-based): typically under 100ms for validation and upload
- **S3 PUT operations**: \~10‚Äì50ms range for most uploads
- **EventBridge**: cold-path delivery latency between 100ms‚Äì1s
- **Agent Bayko** (LLM orchestration): inference workloads expected to run in the 2‚Äì5s range depending on model
- **Output delivery via CloudFront**: negligible latency after cache warmup

---

## 2. Identified Bottleneck Risks

### A. Bedrock Model Inference

- **Why**: External model calls are variable; Claude, Titan, and Jurassic APIs can all introduce multi-second delays
- **Mitigation**: Warn users of expected SLA (\~5‚Äì10s), use caching for repeat requests

### B. S3 + EventBridge Coordination

- **Why**: EventBridge triggers rely on S3 event notification reliability and internal delay
- **Mitigation**: Use retries and DLQs; do not treat as real-time

### C. ECS Cold Starts (if used in production later)

- **Why**: ECS with Fargate can introduce 10‚Äì30s delay on scale-up if not pre-warmed
- **Mitigation**: Keep warm pool of 1 task; decouple batch traffic

---

## 3. Use Case-Specific Traffic Expectations

### Interactive Use (single user prompt)

- Expect 5‚Äì10s total response time
- Most latency from LLM call + EventBridge

### Batch Workflows (e.g., reports, audits)

- Throughput more important than single-response latency
- Use S3 batch and parallel Bayko container fan-out

### Priority Tasks (e.g., compliance alerts)

- Pre-allocated compute may be needed to keep sub-3s SLA
- Bayko containers could run in provisioned mode

---

## 4. Monitoring Considerations

You should track:

- S3 event delay (delivery to EventBridge)
- EventBridge trigger latency (rule execution)
- Bayko response time (end-to-end from trigger to S3 write)
- Output delivery time (S3 ‚Üí CloudFront)

Suggested tools:

- AWS X-Ray (trace propagation if using Lambda)
- CloudWatch custom metrics with timestamp deltas

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This is a **theoretical performance profile**, not the result of a deployed system.
- Future deployments should validate each assumption with measured logs and alert thresholds.
- All claims are drawn from referenced public benchmarks or AWS documentation.
