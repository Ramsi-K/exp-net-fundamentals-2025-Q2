# Multi-Agent System: Brown & Bayko

_Enterprise-grade agent orchestration with secure isolation and modular tool integration._

---

## Agent Brown (Frontend Orchestrator)

### Primary Responsibilities

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Request filtering, injection detection, format validation
- **System Prompt Engineering**: Dynamic prompt construction, processing profile tagging
- **Session Management**: UUID generation, metadata tracking, request routing
- **Content Moderation**: Multi-layer filtering, compliance checking, safety validation

### System Prompt Handling

System prompts are dynamically constructed based on workflow type, safety level, and routing profiles. Profiles and constraints are applied to templates using internal tagging mechanisms.

### Logging & Monitoring

- **Request Tracking**: Full audit trail with UUID correlation
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing time, validation success rate, moderation flags
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, retry logic, fallback responses
- **Security Events**: Suspicious input detection, rate limiting, access violations

### Fallback Behavior

1. **Input Validation Failure**: Return sanitized version with warning flags
2. **S3 Communication Error**: Queue request for retry, notify monitoring
3. **Moderation Block**: Log incident, return policy-compliant error message
4. **System Overload**: Implement backpressure, queue management

## Agent Bayko (Backend Orchestrator)

### Primary Responsibilities

- **MCP Orchestration**: Tool selection, dependency management, resource allocation
- **Multi-Model Routing**: LLM selection based on task complexity and availability
- **Quality Assurance**: Output validation, consistency checking, performance monitoring
- **Artifact Assembly**: Multi-modal processing integration, metadata generation

### MCP Tool Orchestration

Bayko maintains a health-monitored registry of tools organized by task type (LLM, processing, validation, utilities). Tools are selected dynamically based on requirements and fallback strategies.

### Advanced Logging System

- **Tool Usage Metrics**: Latency, success rate, resource consumption per tool
- **Quality Scoring**: Output validation metrics, consistency checks, user feedback
- **Dependency Tracking**: Tool interaction patterns, bottleneck identification
- **Cost Optimization**: Token usage, API call efficiency, resource allocation

### Multi-Model Failover Strategy

1. **Primary Model Failure**: Automatic failover to secondary model with context preservation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Queue management with priority-based processing
3. **Quality Degradation**: Fallback to simpler models with quality warnings
4. **Complete Service Outage**: Graceful degradation with cached responses

## Inter-Agent Communication Protocol

### S3-Based Message Passing

All communication between Brown and Bayko is done via signed S3 objects, which include:

- UUID-based session ID and timestamp
- Processing profile and safety constraints
- Sanitized user request payload and quality thresholds
- Metadata for traceability and logging

### Event-Driven Triggers

- **S3 Event Notifications**: Automatic processing initiation
- **EventBridge Integration**: Complex routing and filtering
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed message handling and retry logic
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic service protection during outages

---

## Production Monitoring & Observability

### CloudWatch Integration

Custom metrics are logged for every agent:

- Processing time by task type
- Session volume
- Component-specific failure rates

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Throughput**: Requests processed per minute
- **Latency**: End-to-end processing time by task type
- **Error Rates**: Failure rates by component and error type
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and API quota consumption
- **Quality Metrics**: Output validation scores, user satisfaction ratings

---

## Security & Compliance

### Agent Isolation

- **Network Segmentation**: VPC-level isolation with controlled communication
- **IAM Role Separation**: Least-privilege access with role-based permissions
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and rotation of API keys
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity trail for compliance and debugging

### Content Safety

- **Multi-Layer Moderation**: Automated filtering with human review escalation
- **Prompt Injection Detection**: Advanced pattern matching and anomaly detection
- **Output Validation**: Content policy enforcement and quality assurance
- **Incident Response**: Automated blocking and manual review workflows
