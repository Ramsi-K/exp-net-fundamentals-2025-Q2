# ðŸ§  System Architecture â€“ Bayko & Brown: Multi-Agent Orchestration Platform

> _Production-grade multi-agent system with secure VPC isolation, event-driven workflows, and modular AI toolchain orchestration for enterprise LLMOps._

This document presents the finalized system architecture for the Bayko & Brown multi-agent platform. It includes production-ready diagrams showing agent isolation, inter-VPC communication, and secure orchestration across a distributed AI pipeline.

The architecture emphasizes:

- Secure networking and IAM isolation
- Asynchronous, event-driven processing
- Modular AI toolchains routed via the Bayko Task Router (formerly referred to as MCP)
- Traceable output, observability, and compliance enforcement

All architecture diagrams below are finalized `.drawio` PNGs. Legacy Mermaid drafts have been archived in [`mermaid-archive.md`](./mermaid-archive.md) for reference.
