## Objective

This journal exists to supplement the architecture diagrams and documentation files. It provides reasoning, context, and additional clarity that may not be visible from the static assets alone.

It is structured to address bootcamp requirements and grade evaluation criteria, with emphasis on:

- Networking fundamentals
- Security design
- Enterprise architecture alignment
- Agent orchestration in a zero-trust environment
