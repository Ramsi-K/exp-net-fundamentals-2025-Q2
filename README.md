# Networking Bootcamp (2025 with Andrew Brown & Tim McConnaughy)

This repo tracks my work in the **2-week Networking Bootcamp** led by Andrew Brown, with technical input from Tim McConnaughy (Aviatrix). The course focuses on **practical cloud networking**, likely covering routing, VPNs, SDN, and multi-cloud infrastructure.

📌 Deliverables are due weekly — no late submissions.  
💥 The goal: go beyond the minimum. Build something that lasts.
